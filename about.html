        <p id="b" class="words">Frogger (フロッガー, Furoggā) is a 1981 arcade game developed by Konami and originally
            published by Sega. In North America, it was published jointly by Sega and Gremlin Industries. The object of
            the game is to direct frogs to their homes one by one by crossing a busy road and navigating a river full of
            hazards.
            Frogger was positively received and followed by several clones and sequels. By 2005, Frogger, in its various
            home video game incarnations, had sold 20 million copies worldwide, including 5 million in the United
            States.[3] The game found its way into popular culture, including television and music.</p>
        <div class="gameplay">
            <h3>Game Play</h3>
            <p class="words">The objective of the game is to guide a frog to each of the empty "frog homes" at the top
                of the screen. The game starts with three, five, or seven frogs, depending on the settings used by the
                operator.[4] Losing them all ends the game. The only player control is the 4 direction joystick used to
                navigate the frog; each push in a direction causes the frog to hop once in that direction. Frogger is
                either single-player or two players alternating.
                The frog starts at the bottom of the screen, which contains a horizontal road occupied by cars, trucks,
                and bulldozers speeding along it. The player must guide the frog between opposing lanes of traffic to
                avoid becoming roadkill, which results in a loss of a life. After the road, there is a median strip
                separating the two major parts of the screen. The upper portion of the screen consists of a river with
                logs, alligators, and turtles, all moving horizontally across the screen. By jumping on swiftly moving
                logs and the backs of turtles and alligators, the player can guide their frog to safety. The player must
                avoid snakes, otters, and the open mouths of alligators. A brightly colored lady frog is sometimes on a
                log and may be carried for bonus points. The very top of the screen contains five "frog homes," which
                are the destinations for each frog. These sometimes contain insects (good) or lurking alligators (bad).
                The game's opening tune is the first verse of a Japanese children's song called Inu No Omawarisan (The
                Dog Policeman). Other Japanese tunes that are played during gameplay include the themes to the anime
                Hana no Ko Lunlun and Araiguma Rascal. The United States release kept the opening song intact and added
                "Yankee Doodle."
                Softline in 1982 stated that "Frogger has earned the ominous distinction of being 'the arcade game with
                the most ways to die.'"[5] There are many different ways to lose a life (illustrated by a skull and
                crossbones symbol where the frog was), including: being hit by or running into a road vehicle, jumping
                into the river's water, running into snakes, otters or an alligator's jaws in the river, jumping into a
                home invaded by an alligator, staying on top of a diving turtle until it has completely submerged,
                riding a log, alligator, or turtle off the side of the screen, jumping into a home already occupied by a
                frog, jumping into the side of a home or the bush, or running out of time.
                When all five frogs are in their homes, the game progresses to the next level with increased difficulty.
                After five levels, the game gets briefly easier before yet again getting progressively harder after each
                level. The player has 30 seconds to guide each frog into one of the homes; this timer resets whenever a
                life is lost or a frog reaches home safely.</p>

        <div class="scoring">
            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <p class="words">Every forward step scores 10 points, and every frog arriving safely home scores 50 points.
                10 points are also awarded per each unused ​1⁄2 second of time. Guiding a lady frog home or eating a fly
                scores 200 points each, and when all 5 frogs reach home to end the level the player earns 1,000 points.
                A single bonus frog is 20,000 points. 99,990 points is the maximum high score that can be achieved on an
                original arcade cabinet; players may exceed this score, but the game only keeps the last 5 digits</p>

        <div class="developmentrelease">
            <h3>Development & Release</h3>
            <p class="words">Sega/Gremlin was skeptical about Frogger's earning potential. This was because no other
                company licensed the game and Frogs, an arcade game developed in-house that also involved frogs, had
                flopped. It was believed that Eliminator would be their next big hit. Elizabeth Falconer, a market
                researcher at Sega/Gremlin, was tasked by Frank Fogleman, the founder of Gremlin, to check Gremlin's
                library of video presentations to see if there was anything worth licensing. It was here that Falconer
                stumbled across Frogger. Falconer later asked her bosses if the game had been reviewed, and it was here
                that she learned that Gremlin was not willing to take a chance on the game because they felt that its
                basic gameplay and "cute" presentation would not make the game sell well. Despite this, Falconer thought
                the game deserved a chance and requested a licensing window of about 90 days so that some prototypes
                could be playtested. She was told her request would be granted if she could convince Gremlin's
                management. Falconer's bosses gave her a chance. On the day she was going to present her pitch for
                Frogger, she was met with executives from Paramount, a company owned by the same company that owned
                Sega/Gremlin. Falconer opened by passing out booklets she made that highlighted Frogger's gameplay and
                sales potential. One of the executives, Jack Cameron Gordon, had immediately tossed the booklet at her
                and stated that Frogger had already been rejected because it was a "women and kids game". Falconer
                replied by speculating that the executives were also among those who turned down Pac-Man, a comment that
                made the room go quiet. After seeing the deflation in resistance, Falconer went on to explain why
                Frogger was appealing - the gameplay's easily memorizable patterns, the game's asthetic attractiveness,
                and its catchy soundtrack were some of the reasons she used. She ended with a simple request: the
                opportunity to play-test a prototype to gauge player reactions. The room went quiet until one of the
                executives relented and told the group to "let her have her goddamn kids game".
                Sega/Gremlin agreed to pay Konami $3,500 a day for a 60-day licensing window. When the EPROMs for
                Frogger arrived from Japan and Falconer retrieved them, Gremlin's engineering department took them and
                used them to create a prototype for Frogger. Once it was completed, the prototype was taken to a bar in
                San Diego called "Spanky's Saloon" where it was playtested by a mostly male audience. Gremlin agreed to
                commit to Frogger if the game tested well at the bar. Gremlin's sales team was impressed at the amount
                of attention the game was getting, and it was all Sega/Gremlin needed to convince buyers at the AMOA
                show in October 1981. Distributors had been sold in Frogger based on its test run at Spanky's alone
